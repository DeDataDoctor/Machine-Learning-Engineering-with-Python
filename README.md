## Setting Up


### PySpark
```bash
 conda install -c conda-forge pyspark 
```
### Spark
I suggest following an online tutorial like [this](https://dltlabs.medium.com/how-to-install-pyspark-13a07da0c75f) or [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-spark-on-ubuntu).

If on Ubuntu you may have to install Java and Scala if not already installed, I did this by

```bash
sudo apt install default-jre
sudo apt install default-jdk
sudo apt install scala
```
